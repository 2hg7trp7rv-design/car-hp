PATCH_NOTES (WAVE 17) — Seed Poster System (Cards)

Goal
- Fill the "no local hero images available" gap without adding heavy assets.
- Improve perceived polish in list views (Cars / Guides / Columns) while keeping Core Web Vitals stable.

Changes
- Added deterministic SVG poster generator:
  - lib/seed.ts (FNV-1a hash + stable unit random)
  - components/visual/SeedPoster.tsx (unique IDs per instance via React useId)
- Cards:
  - components/cars/CarCard.tsx
    - If the local hero image path is missing in public-assets manifest, render SeedPoster instead of leaving the top area blank.
  - components/guide/GuideCard.tsx
    - Added SeedPoster thumbnail (guide variant).
  - components/column/ColumnCard.tsx
    - Added SeedPoster thumbnail (column variant).

Notes
- Posters are inline SVG (no additional network requests).
- Decorative by default (aria-hidden). Card text remains the primary accessible label.

Risk
- Low. No routing/SEO generation logic changed. Prebuild scripts pass.
