PATCH REPORT — WAVE 16

Status
- Home hero: pointer tracking is scoped to the hero element (no global pointermove).
- Search: state updates that can trigger heavy list renders are moved into a transition.
- Search/Compare: a11y status announcements (aria-live) added.
- Hamburger menu: active link now exposes aria-current.

Why this is correct (high level)
- INP is sensitive to long tasks and heavy rerenders triggered by interactions.
  The changes reduce global event pressure and lower the urgency of heavy UI updates.
- aria-live regions improve usability for assistive tech users without changing visual layout.

Risk
- Low to Medium
  - Home parallax: behavior changes slightly (now only responds when pointer is within hero).
    This is intentional and improves performance.
  - Search transition: results may update a fraction later under load (intended tradeoff).

Action (post-deploy checks)
1) Home
- Move the cursor inside the hero:
  - Parallax reacts.
- Move cursor outside:
  - Parallax resets.
- On mobile:
  - Parallax remains disabled.

2) Search
- Type quickly:
  - Input remains responsive, results update smoothly.
- Confirm screen-reader status changes:
  - "検索中…" then result count.

3) Compare
- Add/remove cars:
  - Status should reflect the number of selected cars.

4) Menu
- Open hamburger menu:
  - Current page link should have aria-current="page".
