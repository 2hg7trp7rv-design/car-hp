PATCH NOTES (wave6)

Goal:
- Treat every page as a single continuous artwork.
- Text is part of the design, so we avoid 'unfinished' UI states.

What was missing (from screen recording):
1) Full-width white band (NEXT STORY) breaking Stage.
2) Large blank thumbnail areas on related cards when images are missing.
3) Menu overlay briefly stacking over route loading.

What we changed:
- Heritage detail: Next story now stays inside Stage and is presented as a Porcelain panel.
- Global loading UI: replaced skeleton grid with minimal 'curtain' style indicator.
- Hamburger menu: closes immediately on link click.
- Content cards: improved placeholder visuals + added safe fallback images where data is missing.
