CBJ Masterpiece Wave5 - Notes

Goal
- Tighten the “one-work” consistency further by removing the last brand mismatches in content metadata,
  and refining interaction styling so Stage stays silent while Porcelain keeps usability.

What was missing / fixed
1) Remaining old-brand strings inside content JSON (SEO titles / image credits)
   - GUIDE seoTitle fields contained “CAR BOUTIQUE GUIDE” which could leak into page titles.
   - Replaced with “GUIDE” to keep titles consistent with the sitewide brand template.
   - Heritage heroImageCredit “Photo: CAR BOUTIQUE (archive)” updated to “CAR BOUTIQUE JOURNAL (archive)”.

2) Link hover behavior: Stage vs Porcelain
   - Global hover underline was visually noisy on Stage.
   - Stage: hover = color shift only (no underline).
   - Porcelain panels: hover = underline maintained for usability.

3) Small housekeeping
   - README / tsconfig display updated to CAR BOUTIQUE JOURNAL.
