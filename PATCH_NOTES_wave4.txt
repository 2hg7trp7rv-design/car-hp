CBJ Masterpiece Wave4 - Notes

Goal
- Preserve the "Stage (dark exhibition space) + Porcelain (white archive shelf)" concept across every reachable route,
  including internal dashboards, without sacrificing practical web usability.

What was missing / fixed
1) Internal routes were broken after switching the global canvas to Stage
   - app/_internal/* pages had light-only layout assumptions and became hard to read.
   - Fixed by wrapping each internal page with DetailFixedBackground + Porcelain panel.

2) Brand / publisher consistency for structured data
   - lib/seo/jsonld.ts had a CAR BOUTIQUE special-case which could silently omit publisher url/logo.
   - Fixed to always attach publisher url/logo by default.

3) Color-scheme consistency (browser-native controls)
   - Stage is dark by default now (color-scheme: dark).
   - Added .porcelain { color-scheme: light; } so white panels keep native UI consistent.
   - Applied "porcelain" class to key white panels across pages.

4) Remaining "CAR BOUTIQUE" strings in fallback/legacy UI components
   - Updated to CAR BOUTIQUE JOURNAL (HeroSection / HomeNavDrawer / MobileMenu / SiteHeader).
