PATCH REPORT — WAVE 15

Status
- Google Fonts <link> loader removed from runtime.
- Fonts are self-hosted and optimized via next/font/google.
- Handwriting fonts are not preloaded to avoid LCP impact.
- Tailwind font-family keys remain stable via CSS variable mapping.

Risk
- Medium (font changes always affect rendering).
  - Biggest risk: subset/type definition mismatch for some JP fonts in Next.
    We chose a strict-safe subset config. If any JP glyph falls back to system fonts,
    switch Noto Serif JP to local self-hosted WOFF2 in the next wave.

Action (post-deploy checks)
1) Visual QA
- Home + any long Japanese article page:
  - Confirm Japanese text uses the intended serif (not system fallback).
  - Confirm headings keep the same hierarchy and spacing.

2) Network QA
- Confirm no requests to:
  - fonts.googleapis.com
  - fonts.gstatic.com
  (use DevTools or any header/network inspector)

3) CLS / LCP sanity
- First load on mobile: verify there is no “text jump” after render.
