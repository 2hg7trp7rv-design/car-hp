Wave9 Masterpiece – Notes

Goal: Treat every piece of text/UI as part of the artwork, while preserving the site's practical utility.

What changed:
1) Breadcrumbs unified across remaining catalog/utility pages using the shared <Breadcrumb> component.
   - Removed ad-hoc breadcrumb <nav> blocks (slate palette) from Cars taxonomy pages, News pages, and Start.
2) Typography tokens applied to headers where missing (cb-eyebrow / cb-title-display / cb-lead).
3) Porcelain palette tightened: removed lingering slate text colors in the edited pages to keep a single 'paper' language.
4) Car compare candidates: compare-add action is now a quiet overlay inside the card (no floating button outside the layout).
