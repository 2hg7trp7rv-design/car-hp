PATCH_REPORT (WAVE 17) — What to verify after deploy

1) List pages
- /cars : every card has a visual top block (image if exists, poster otherwise).
- /guide : cards have a poster thumbnail.
- /column : cards have a poster thumbnail.

2) Performance sanity
- No new external requests for images/fonts should appear.
- Scrolling in lists should stay smooth (poster is pure SVG).

3) Accessibility
- Poster is decorative (should not add extra SR noise).
- Focus/keyboard navigation remains unchanged.

Rollback
- Revert WAVE 17 files:
  - components/visual/SeedPoster.tsx
  - lib/seed.ts
  - card changes in CarCard/GuideCard/ColumnCard
