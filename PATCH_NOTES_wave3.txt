Wave3 Notes

Goal
- Keep the website usable (search/compare/sitemap/contact etc.) without breaking the "site as an artwork" rule.
- Enforce the 2-layer system everywhere:
  Stage = dark, fixed, quiet
  Porcelain = white panel where practical UI lives

What was missing in Wave2
1) START / SITE MAP
- They were already on the Stage (DetailFixedBackground) but breadcrumb + hero header were still light-theme text (slate-900).
- Result: parts of the page could be unreadable and the "one-work" continuity broke.

2) CONTACT
- Still used the previous light-gradient/landing pattern and extra background layers.
- Result: the site suddenly felt like a different product.

3) SELL branches (hub-sell-compare / hub-sell-loan)
- Same issue as START: stage background + dark text outside porcelain.

4) NEWS detail JSON-LD
- Organization name had a duplicated word: "CAR BOUTIQUE JOURNAL JOURNAL".

What Wave3 did
- Wrapped START / SITE MAP / hub-sell-compare / hub-sell-loan content in a porcelain panel.
- Rebuilt CONTACT as Stage + Porcelain while keeping the form functionality.
- Fixed the NEWS JSON-LD typo.
- Switched the global body canvas to the Stage (bg #07080a) to avoid iOS overscroll white flashes.
