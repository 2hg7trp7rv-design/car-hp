PATCH REPORT — WAVE 13

Status
- Added security headers + CSP Report-Only.
- Added CSP report endpoint.

Risk
- Low (Report-Only does not block). Enforce requires deliberate env flip.

Action
- Deploy.
- (Optional) Verify headers with a curl/inspector.
- Leave CSP in Report-Only for 24–72h, then enforce only after reviewing violations.
