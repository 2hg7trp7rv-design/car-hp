PATCH_NOTES_wave8.txt

Goal: push “text as design” and ensure every page (including error/404/internal tools) fits the Stage (dark exhibition) + Porcelain (white archive shelf) language.

1) Error / 404 pages redesigned as part of the exhibition
- app/not-found.tsx: moved from generic slate/teal template to Stage + Porcelain panel.
- app/error.tsx: same; keeps reset and digest while matching the site’s typographic tokens.

2) Utility pages typography consistency
- app/search/page.tsx: header rewritten to use the text-as-design tokens (cb-eyebrow / cb-lead) and harmonized title scale.
- app/compare/page.tsx: removed the custom breadcrumb <nav> and switched to the shared Breadcrumb component; tightened the typographic scale and border colors.

3) Missing-image “blank” prevention polish
- components/content/ContentGridCard.tsx placeholder text changed to “ARCHIVE” to match the row cards.

4) Internal tools pages palette cleanup
- app/_internal/* pages: replaced leftover slate palette classes with the unified porcelain palette to avoid “different site” feel even in internal dashboards.

5) Regenerated audit outputs
- public/_internal/audit.json and src/generated/audit.generated.json were refreshed after running scripts/content-audit.mjs.
