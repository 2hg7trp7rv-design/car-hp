WAVE 14 — PERFORMANCE (LCP) / IMAGE OPTIMIZATION

Goal
- Cut LCP weight on the most-visited entry points (Home + hub/detail pages).
- Do it without changing layout/UX, and without removing any functionality.

Changes
1) Home hero KV (kv-home.png / kv-home-m.png)
- Added WebP variants:
  - /public/images/exhibit/kv-home.webp
  - /public/images/exhibit/kv-home-m.webp
- Updated HomeMasterpiece <picture> to prefer WebP with PNG fallback.
- Added width/height + fetchPriority=high to stabilize CLS and improve LCP fetch priority.

2) Exhibit large background KVs (hub/detail pages)
- Re-encoded the large WebP assets to dramatically smaller WebP files (quality=80),
  keeping the same filenames so all existing routes keep working:
  - kv-cars.webp, kv-makers.webp, kv-compare.webp, kv-search.webp,
    kv-sitemap.webp, kv-bodytypes.webp, kv-start.webp, kv-segments.webp
- Stored originals under docs/_asset_originals/exhibit/*.orig.webp (NOT public) for rollback/inspection.

3) DetailFixedBackground
- Added decoding="async" + fetchPriority="high" to the fixed hero <img>.

4) Public asset manifest
- Updated data/_internal/public-assets.json to include the new WebP assets.

Notes
- This wave targets “weight on the wire” first (Core Web Vitals: LCP/INP/CLS).
- Visual impact should be negligible (PSNR ~ 39–43dB vs originals).
