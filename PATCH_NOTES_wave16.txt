WAVE 16 — INP + ACCESSIBILITY HARDENING

Goal
- Improve interaction responsiveness (INP) by reducing high-frequency work on the main thread.
- Strengthen accessibility without changing the site’s visual tone.

Changes
1) Home hero pointer parallax (INP)
- Updated: components/home/HomeMasterpiece.tsx
  - pointermove listener is now attached to the hero element (not window).
  - Disabled automatically for:
    - prefers-reduced-motion
    - coarse pointer (touch)
  - getBoundingClientRect is cached and refreshed at a small interval to reduce overhead.
  - Parallax resets on pointerleave.

2) Search UI responsiveness + a11y status (INP + a11y)
- Updated: app/search/search-client.tsx
  - Heavy result updates are wrapped in React transition (useTransition) to keep input responsive.
  - Added a screen-reader status region (aria-live) for:
    - searching / error / result-count / suggestions.

3) Compare page a11y status
- Updated: app/compare/compare-client.tsx
  - Added an aria-live status region announcing selected cars count.

4) Global menu a11y
- Updated: components/layout/HamburgerMenu.tsx
  - Adds aria-current="page" on the active destination.

Notes
- These changes are additive and do not alter content, routing, or indexing strategy.
