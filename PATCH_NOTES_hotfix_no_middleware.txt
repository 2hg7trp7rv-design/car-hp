HOTFIX: Disable Next.js Middleware temporarily

Why:
- Vercel is experiencing a platform incident where deployments that include Middleware Functions can fail during "Deploying outputs".

What changed:
- middleware.ts -> middleware.disabled.ts (code preserved; middleware not deployed)
- Added vercel.json with trailingSlash:false to keep canonical URL behavior without middleware.

To re-enable:
- Rename middleware.disabled.ts back to middleware.ts

Important:
- Enforce primary domain + www->non-www redirects in Vercel Project Settings -> Domains.
