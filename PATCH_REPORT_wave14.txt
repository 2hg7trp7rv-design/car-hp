PATCH REPORT — WAVE 14

Status
- Home KV now ships WebP first (PNG fallback).
- Heavy exhibit background assets re-encoded (major byte reduction).
- Background images marked decoding=async and high fetch priority.
- public-assets manifest updated.

Risk
- Low.
  - All production filenames remain valid (no route changes).
  - PNG fallback kept for browsers without WebP support.
  - Originals preserved outside /public (docs/_asset_originals).

Action (post-deploy checks)
- Open: / (Home), /cars, /guide, /column, /compare, /search
- Confirm KV visuals look unchanged.
- Confirm network transfer size for KV images is smaller (DevTools or any header inspector).
