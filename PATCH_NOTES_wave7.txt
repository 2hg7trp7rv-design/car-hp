PATCH_NOTES_wave7

Goal
- Raise typographic and surface consistency so text reads as a designed object on every page.

What changed
1) Typography baseline
- Headings and body text: tuned tracking/leading and added modern wrapping (balance/pretty) in globals.css.
- Added small “text-as-design” token classes (eyebrow/meta/title/lead).

2) Porcelain surface unification
- Added a subtle grain + highlight layer for Porcelain panels via the new `.porcelain-panel` helper.
- Applied `.porcelain-panel` to all major Porcelain wrappers (indexes, utilities, internal dashboards, taxonomy pages).

3) Breadcrumb polish
- Breadcrumb now uses the sans stack and a quieter separator to reduce visual noise.

4) Micro copy / placeholders
- Home CTA “Car Index” -> “Enter Cars”.
- Content row thumbnail fallback label -> “ARCHIVE” (no more random initials).

Safety checks
- scripts/guardrails.mjs: OK
- scripts/content-audit.mjs: OK
- scripts/generate-sitemaps.mjs: OK
- scripts/generate-robots.mjs + verify-robots.mjs: OK
