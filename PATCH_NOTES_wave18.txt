CBJ V2 — WAVE 18 (Status as Exhibition)

Goal
- Make 404/500/error states feel like part of the exhibition (not a broken product).
- Preserve recoverability: always offer a next action (Home / Exhibition / Canvas / Index + Search).
- Keep it fully progressive: works without JS.

What changed
- Added a reusable StatusPanel component with a deterministic SeedPoster (“status poster”).
- Upgraded the global 404 and global error pages to use StatusPanel and offer recovery paths.
- Added app/global-error.tsx to catch errors thrown in the root layout/template (Next.js convention).
- Added segment-level not-found pages for dynamic routes:
  - /cars/[slug]
  - /guide/[slug]
  - /column/[slug]
  - /heritage/[slug]
  - /news/[id]
- Upgraded segment error pages (CARS / GUIDE / COLUMN / HERITAGE / NEWS) to use StatusPanel.

Why this is correct
- Users hit 404/500. Awwwards-level sites treat those states as part of the narrative AND make it easy to recover.
- We keep the brand language consistent (“archive / exhibition / canvas”) while staying explicit about what happened.
- Search is exposed directly on 404/not-found states to avoid dead ends.
- We avoid “soft 404”: Next returns proper 404 status when notFound() is used, which is important for crawl hygiene.

Notes
- No new dependencies.
- No sitemap generation changes required.
